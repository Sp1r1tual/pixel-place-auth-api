# 🎨 Pixel Place (Authentication service)

**Pixel Place** is an interactive online platform where users collaborate to create a massive pixel canvas — one pixel at a time. Inspired by projects like Reddit r/place, w/place, and other collective art experiments, it turns chaos and creativity into a living digital mosaic.

## 💡 Concept

**Pixel Place isn’t just a project — it’s a social experiment.** It’s about coexistence on a single canvas, where hundreds of users shape a shared digital world — sometimes chaotic, sometimes beautiful, always alive.

It’s pixel democracy: **each user gets one pixel, but together, they build art.**
